#### 1. Introduction:
<ul>
  <li>This is my Bachelors of Science Degree Capstone Project, where I apply my the theory of my Computer Science - Machine Learning Major and Business Analytics Minors</li>
  <li>As the rising trend of Phishing Attacks within the scope of UIC Student, I decided to build a data frames of machine learnings models with the hope to use technology to punish technology criminals!/li>
  <li>There are three ML models has been accomplished, and the website are on the process of building into production. I am planning to release the project within 2024.</li>
</ul>

#### 2. Methodology:
The models was build based on the dataset Phishing Legitimate Full.csv from Mendeley Data, with 10,000 data points from 5000 legitimate webpages and 5000 phishing webpages with 48 websites features to analyze

The project use three main Machine Learning model to build, including:
<ul>
  <li>Decision Tree Model</li>
  <li>Logistics Regression Model</li>
  <li>Random Forest Classification Model</li>
</ul>
